      target="_blank" title="beatles on wiki">The Beatles</a> were an
      English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.
      With a line-up comprising <strong>John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison
      and Ringo Starr</strong>, they are regarded as the most influential band of all
      time. With a sound rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s <u>rock and roll</u>,
      the group were integral to the evolution of pop music into an art form,
      and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:15px;">
      They often incorporated elements of classical music, older pop,
      and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways,
      and they experimented with a number of musical styles in later years,
      ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock.
      As they continued to draw influences from a variety of cultural sources,
      their musical and lyrical sophistication grew, and they came to be seen
      as embodying the era's socio-cultural movements.
