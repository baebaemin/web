      (born September 13, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist.
      Classically trained on piano as a child, Apple began <u>composing her own
      songs when she was eight years old</u>. Her debut album, <strong>Tidal</strong>, written when
      Apple was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best
      Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single "Criminal". She followed
      with When the Pawn... (1999), produced by Jon Brion, which was also
      critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum</p>
      <p style="margin-top:15px;">
      For her third album, Extraordinary Machine (2005), Apple again
      collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002.
      However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not
      to release the record, leading fans to erroneously protest Epic Records,
      believing that the label was withholding its release.
      The album was eventually reproduced without Brion and released in
      October 2005. The album was certified gold, and nominated for a Grammy
      Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. In 2012, she released her fourth studio
      album, The Idler Wheel..., which received critical praise and was
      followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the
      Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2013.
