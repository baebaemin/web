<h2>across the universe</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe">"Across the Universe"</a> is a song by the English rock band the Beatles.
  It was written by <u>John Lennon</u> and credited to Lennon–McCartney.
  The song first appeared on the 1969 various artists' charity compilation
  album No One's Gonna Change Our World and later, in a different form,
  on their 1970 album <strong>Let It Be</strong>, the group's final released album.

  <p style = "margin-top:15px;"> One night in 1967, the phrase "words are flowing out like endless rain
    into a paper cup" came to Lennon after hearing his then-wife Cynthia,
    according to Lennon, "going on and on about something".
    Later, after "she'd gone to sleep – and I kept hearing these words over and
    over, flowing like an endless stream", Lennon went downstairs and turned it
    into a song. He began to write the rest of the lyrics and when he was done,
    he went to bed and forgot about them.
